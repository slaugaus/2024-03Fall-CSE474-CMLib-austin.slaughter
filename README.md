# CSE 474 - Software Quality Assurance - Configuration Management Library

This repo contains Configuration Items (CIs): "anything that needs to be controlled in order to deliver the final product."

CIs need to "have their state controlled" (be in a Git repo), and public account-level GitHub repos are what the course designers chose for us students.

(This is BYU-Idaho coursework.)
