# CSE 474 - Software Quality Assurance - Configuration Management Library

This repo contains Configuration Items (CIs): "anything that needs to be controlled in order to deliver the final product."

CIs need to "have their state controlled" (be in a Git repo), and public account-level GitHub repos are what the course designers chose for us students.

Check the branches for weekly progress.

Because GitHub doesn't have a .docx preview, ChatGPT and I hacked together an Action that [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)s them into wiki pages for me! [Check them out!](https://github.com/slaugaus/2024-Fall-CSE474-CMLib-austin.slaughter/wiki)

(This is BYU-Idaho coursework.)
